# PagedJS Infinite Loop Investigation

## Problem Description

There is a reproducible infinite loop issue in PagedJS when rendering a specific HTML document. It causes pagedJS (which this project is a fork of) to not display a large block of content.

## Test Setup

This directory contains:

1. **chrometest.html** - Original test file that demonstrates the infinite loop
2. **chrometest-with-fix.html** - Same file with a POC fix applied
3. **minimal-chrome-fix.js** - Proof-of-concept fix that stops the infinite loop
4. **realistic-browser-test.js** - Automated testing script to compare both files

## How to Run the Test

### Prerequisites
```bash
npm install
```

### Manual Testing
1. Open `chrometest.html` in Chrome - you'll see the infinite loop occur
2. Open `chrometest-with-fix.html` in Chrome - the issue should be resolved

### Automated Testing
```bash
node realistic-browser-test.js
```

This will:
- Launch Chrome with both test files
- Take screenshots at different stages
- Analyze content visibility
- Generate a comparison report in `realistic-test-output/`

## What We've Observed

- The infinite loop occurs during PagedJS rendering
- The POC fix in `minimal-chrome-fix.js` prevents the infinite loop
- The issue appears to be related to specific elements in the HTML
- The automated test shows clear differences between the working and broken versions

## Next Steps

Your task is to analyze this issue and develop a proper solution that:
1. Fixes the root cause of the infinite loop
2. Integrates cleanly with PagedJS
3. Doesn't break other functionality
4. Can be applied generally to prevent similar issues

The POC fix works but is element-specific. We need a more robust solution.
